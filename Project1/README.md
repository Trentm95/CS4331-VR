## Description

The goal of this project was to create a virtual reality home. This project was made using the A-frame library, Sketchfab for gltf models, and Photoshop for texture downscaling.

### Outside View

An outside view of the house. For this project I decorated the large bottom floor room. You can also see the ocean skybox in the background.
