## Game Description
This is a standalone, first-person, survival game in which the goal is to build your civilization as large as possible while keeping below a certain water pollution threshhold. In order to build your civilization, you must collect enough resources to construct a structure. More buildings become available as you level up. As you build your civilization, you will gain civilization points; however, you will also increase water pollution. Some structures help decrease water pollution - such as water treatment structures. You must achieve enough civilization points in order to level up. Natural disasters such as storms and volcanoes will be triggered throughout level progression that contribute to water pollution. If you exceed the water pollution threshhold, you lose the game. If you reach the max civilization level, you win the game.

## Getting Started
We chose to develop our game in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), and we imported free model assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). The scripts were to be done in Unity's default programming language, C#. For the island design, we imported a height map of the Kaua'i island in Hawaii, and smoothed out any rough edges so the player could navigate with ease.
